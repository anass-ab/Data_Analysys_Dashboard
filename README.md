# Imdadat.CO-Data-Analysis ( Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel ) 

## Project Objectives:

- To analyze and optimize the supply chain performance of Imdadat.co
- Monitor key supplier metrics including defect rates, availability, and lead times
- Evaluate supplier delivery performance and quality standards
- Identify areas for improvement in the supply chain
 
## DataSet used :
- <a href="https://github.com/anass-ab/Data_Analysys_Dashboard/blob/main/Supply-Chain-Dashboard-Template-TemplateLab.com_.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## DataSet used (Description) :

-	Supply chain performance metrics from November 2023 to September 2024
-	Supplier performance data tracking:
- Defect rates and types
- Availability percentages
-	Lead times
- On-time delivery rates
-	Quality impact classifications (No Impact, Impact, Rejected)

## Key KPI Questions :

-	What factors are contributing to the fluctuating defect rate between 2-7% across different months, and why did it peak in March 2024?
-	Why are Suppliers 1 and 2 consistently underperforming with "Unacceptable" ratings despite having different defect rate patterns?
-	How can we improve the overall availability rate from 91.4% to meet higher industry standards, and what are the main constraints?
-	What operational changes are needed to reduce the average lead time of 9.1 days, considering the consistent trend shown in the graph?
-	Why is there a significant disparity between Supplier 5's performance (67% no-impact rate) and other suppliers, and what best practices can be learned?
- How can we improve the On-Time Supplied rate of 81.2% to meet the minimum acceptable threshold of 80% across all suppliers?
-	What quality control measures can be implemented to increase the No Impact Defects rate from 57.1% to a higher percentage?
-	Why does the delivery time analysis show varying performance levels (from 76.6% to 85.6%) across suppliers, and what factors contribute to these differences

##  Process :

# 1 Data Collection & Monitoring
-	Track monthly defect rates from Nov '23 to Sep '24
-	Monitor availability percentages across all suppliers
-	Record lead times and delivery performance metrics
-	Measure supplier-specific quality standards
# 2 Performance Assessment
-	Evaluate supplier defect rates and categorize them:
-	No Impact
-	Impact
-	Rejected
-	Compare actual vs. limit thresholds (80% benchmark)
-	Classify supplier rankings: Tolerable, Acceptable, Unacceptable
# 3 Quality Analysis
-	Calculate defect percentages for each supplier
-	Analyze defect types and their impact on operations
-	Monitor monthly quality trends
-	Identify suppliers exceeding defect thresholds
# 4 Delivery Performance Evaluation
-	Track supplier delivery time compliance
-	Analyze lead time trends (target: 10 days)
-	Measure on-time delivery rates
-	Calculate monthly availability percentages
# 5 Supplier Rating System
-	Implement ranking criteria:
-	Above 83%: Tolerable
-	80-83%: Acceptable
-	Below 80%: Unacceptable
-	Regular performance reviews
-	Supplier classification based on combined metrics
# 6 Continuous Monitoring & Reporting
-	Monthly performance tracking
-	Trend analysis of key metrics
-	Regular supplier performance reviews
-	Dashboard updates and maintenance
